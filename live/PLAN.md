We need to fetch all orders (created and cancelled)

- CAN'T TRACK INDIVIDUAL ORDERS - BUT CAN EACH TRADE
  Without individual order tracking, we can't know if:
  It's ONE trader with 683,470 WIF
  It's 100 traders with ~6,834 WIF each
  It's a mix of different sized orders

- TRADES MUST BE CORRELATED TO THE CANCELED ORDERS
