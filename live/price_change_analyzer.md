# Price Change Analyzer - Find Extreme Price Moves with Whale Activity

## What Does This Tool Do?

Analyzes historical price data from InfluxDB to find time intervals with the largest price changes, then correlates those movements with whale order book events that occurred during the same period.

**Key insight:** See exactly what large orders appeared, increased, or executed during the most volatile price movements.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Find top 10 price changes in last 24 hours using 1-minute windows
python live/price_change_analyzer.py

# Analyze 1-second intervals over last hour (high granularity)
python live/price_change_analyzer.py --interval 1s --lookback 1h

# Find movements >0.5% in last 6 hours using 5-second windows
python live/price_change_analyzer.py --interval 5s --lookback 6h --min-change 0.5 --top 20

# Different symbol
python live/price_change_analyzer.py --symbol ETH_USDT --interval 10s --lookback 12h

# Export results to JSON for further analysis
python live/price_change_analyzer.py --output json --export-path results.json

# Export to CSV for spreadsheet analysis
python live/price_change_analyzer.py --output csv --export-path analysis.csv
```

## Trading Insights to Look For

### Pattern 1: Market Buy Cascade (Price Surge)
```
Rank #1: +1.234% price change

Whale Activity Summary:
  market_buy      :  45 events, $25,000,000 total
  market_sell     :   2 events, $500,000 total
```
**Interpretation:** Aggressive buying dominated the interval. Buyers were taking liquidity.

### Pattern 2: Wall Building Before Move
```
Rank #1: +0.856% price change

Event Timeline:
  12:00:01 new_bid    $93000.00 × 50.0000 = $4,650,000
  12:00:03 new_bid    $93050.00 × 40.0000 = $3,722,000
  12:00:05 new_bid    $93100.00 × 60.0000 = $5,586,000
  12:00:10 market_buy $93150.00 × 100.0000 = $9,315,000
```
**Interpretation:** Large bids stacked before price moved up. Possible coordinated accumulation.

### Pattern 3: Spoofing / Wall Removal
```
Rank #1: -0.932% price change

Event Timeline:
  12:05:00 new_ask     $94000.00 × 200.0000 = $18,800,000
  12:05:02 decrease    $94000.00 × 180.0000 = $16,920,000
  12:05:05 market_sell $93800.00 × 50.0000 = $4,690,000
```
**Interpretation:** Large sell wall appeared then vanished, followed by selling. Possible manipulation.

### Pattern 4: Absorption (Orders Filled)
```
Rank #1: -1.145% price change

Whale Activity Summary:
  decrease        :  67 events, $15,000,000 total
  market_sell     :  23 events, $8,500,000 total
```
**Interpretation:** Heavy selling into bids. Support levels being absorbed.

### Pattern 5: Balanced but Volatile
```
Rank #1: +0.456% price change

Whale Activity Summary:
  market_buy      :  15 events, $5,000,000 total
  market_sell     :  14 events, $4,800,000 total
  increase        :  25 events, $3,200,000 total
```
**Interpretation:** High activity but balanced. Choppy price action with no clear winner.

## Understanding the Data Source

### Prerequisites
This tool requires:
1. **InfluxDB** running with data from `orderbook_tracker.py`
2. Two measurements in InfluxDB:
   - `orderbook_price` - Price snapshots (mid_price, best_bid, best_ask, spread)
   - `orderbook_whale_events` - Filtered whale events

### Data Flow
```
orderbook_tracker.py → InfluxDB → price_change_analyzer.py
   (collects data)    (stores)      (analyzes)
```

**Important:** You must run `orderbook_tracker.py --influx` to collect data before using this analyzer.

### How It Works

1. **Query Price Data:**
   - Fetches `mid_price` from InfluxDB for the lookback period
   - Uses `aggregateWindow` to find first and last price in each interval
   - Calculates percentage change: `(end_price - start_price) / start_price * 100`

2. **Filter & Rank:**
   - Keeps only intervals with `abs(change) >= min_change`
   - Sorts by absolute change (largest moves first)
   - Returns top N intervals

3. **Correlate Whale Events:**
   - For each top interval, queries `orderbook_whale_events`
   - Fetches all events within the interval's time range
   - Groups by event type and aggregates USD volume

4. **Display Results:**
   - Shows ranked intervals with price change info
   - Summarizes whale activity by type
   - Lists chronological event timeline

## Output Format Details

### Terminal Output
- Color-coded, human-readable format
- Shows event summaries and timelines
- Limited to first 20 events per interval for readability

## Performance Considerations

### Interval Size vs Query Speed

**Fast queries (1s - 10s intervals):**
- More granular data
- More intervals to analyze
- Suitable for short lookback periods (1h - 6h)

**Medium queries (1m - 5m intervals):**
- Balanced granularity
- Good for 12h - 24h lookback
- Recommended for most use cases

**Slow queries (15m - 1h intervals):**
- Lower granularity
- Fewer intervals
- Suitable for long lookback (7d+)

### Tips for Large Datasets

1. **Start with larger intervals** for initial exploration
2. **Narrow down time range** if specific period interests you
3. **Use min-change filter** to reduce result set
4. **Export to JSON/CSV** for heavy analysis (faster than terminal)

## Common Questions

**Q: What if no data is found?**
A: Make sure `orderbook_tracker.py --influx` is running and has collected data for your symbol and time period.

**Q: Can I analyze historical data from weeks ago?**
A: Yes, as long as the data exists in InfluxDB and hasn't been deleted by retention policies.

**Q: What's a good interval size?**
A: Start with `1m` for general analysis. Use `5s` or `10s` for high-frequency moves. Use `15m` for longer-term patterns.

**Q: Why do some intervals have no whale events?**
A: Price can move without whale activity (many small orders) or whale events may have been filtered out by tracker's min_volume/min_usd settings.

**Q: How accurate is the timing?**
A: Timestamps are precise to milliseconds. However, interval boundaries are aggregated (e.g., 1-minute window groups all events in that minute).

**Q: Can I see the raw InfluxDB queries?**
A: Yes, check the `find_price_changes()` and `get_whale_events()` methods in the source code.

**Q: Does this analyze live data?**
A: No, it analyzes historical data stored in InfluxDB. For live monitoring, use `orderbook_tracker.py` or `orderbook_monitor.py`.

**Q: What's the difference between this and orderbook_monitor.py?**
A: `orderbook_monitor.py` shows current prices and recent whale events. This tool finds and ranks the most extreme price moves.

## Tips for Effective Analysis

1. **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with default settings, then adjust interval/lookback based on what you find

2. **Compare event summaries** - Look at ratio of market_buy vs market_sell to gauge aggressor direction

3. **Watch for patterns** - Same event types appearing before similar price moves = potential signal

4. **Cross-reference with chart** - Use exported data alongside price charts for visual confirmation

5. **Export for deeper analysis** - JSON output can be processed by other tools (Python, R, Excel)

6. **Look for imbalance** - Heavy buying or selling usually precedes continuation of the move

7. **Note the order** - Events at start of interval might have caused the move; events at end might be reaction

## Exit

Press **Ctrl+C** to interrupt analysis (though most queries complete quickly).
